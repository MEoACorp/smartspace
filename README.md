PROJECT BELVEDERE

Welcome to the completely immersed SmartWorld.  Over the next few months all the necessary code and instruction to incorporate any and every device you own into your own customized fully connected and interactive SmartSpace.  

Imagine taking your Smart Home, Smart Phone, OnStar, SmartTV, SmartWatch, XBox One, PS4, Wii, Laptop, Development Kits, and Cloud Services, and Setting up an "Always-On" VLAN (Virtual Network) so a command given to any of our devices will achieve the same outcome no matter your geographical location.  

Now throw in A little Speech-to-text and TTS for the ability to control everything totally hands free, Machine Learning Applications with focus on your choice of situations (Mine is NFL Football Prediction, Identity Verification (Face and Voice, Thumbprints), and soon to be added, the "Attitude Algorythm" 

Mix a "secret recipe" of database entries with an Analytital Prediction app, and you have a personal assistant with a virtual "mind of its own" and each one ends up with their own unique "personalities" or "character", if you will.

Once This Project Is Complete I will be posting Video, Pictures, Screenshots, and Contact info for anyone interested in a tutorial .  Enjoy!
